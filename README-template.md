## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla Javascript
- Mobile-first workflow
- Gulp setup
- Awesome Fonts

### What I learned

For this I wanted to work on Gulp.  I first made a starter Gulp project and played around with what I could get to work.  I was able to get these to work:

- gulp-sass
- gulp-postsass
- cssnano
- autoprefixer
- gulp-terser
- gulp-concat
- browser-sync

These all made this project that much better.  I still need to work on getting some image optimizing ones to work but this is a good start.

Also this is my first project with Javascript.  I'm taking a class currently in college with it.  From now on.  Any project I do in Front-End Mentor has to have Javascript involved.

### Continued development

I want to add a couple more Gulp tasks like image optimizing and add webp's to my Gulp starter.  I need to continue to work on Javascript...continually.

### Useful resources

- [JavaScript Client-side Form Validation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsd4FNGTRBw&t=1503s) - This was the primary Youtube video I used to help with the email verification.  Great resource!
- [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJZv4d5rbIKd4QHMPkcABCw) - I watch his videos over and over again for great CSS/Sass tips and tricks.
